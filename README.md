# News-classification-Kmeans

This project uses K means classification to classify Indian news headlines into 3 categories:-
1. Indian
2. Others
3. Unknown

Indian news headlines dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.com

This project uses truncated dataset of only 2000 size.

CSV file is converted into txt file which then given as input without label since this is unsupervised learning algorithm.

Accuracy of 64 percent is achieved.

You can create more cluster by the actual categories instead of others. Use OneHotEncoder for categories and changing size of the cluster accordingly.
